Parrot is a Dart framework for building applications.

- **Declarative**: Parrot makes it easy to create instance dependencies. Design simple providers for each instance in your application, and when your instance needs to depend on another instance, Parrot will effectively provide the reference. declarative instances make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Modular**: Modular design makes it easy to manage your application. Parrot provides a simple and effective modular architecture, you can easily combine instances into a functional module, which can be easily used in other modules.
- **Flexible**: Parrot is a framework that can be used in any Dart project. You can use Parrot to build a simple command-line application, or you can use it to build a complex web application. Parrot is flexible and can be used in any Dart project.

# Documentation

You can find the Parrot documentation [on the website](https://parrot.odroe.com).

> If you find any errors in the documentation, please [create an issue](https://github.com/odroe/parrot/issues/new) or [sending a pull request](https://github.com/odroe/parrot/pulls) to help us improve it.

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://parrot.odroe.com/examples). Hre is one of the most popular examples to get you started:

```dart
import 'package:parrot/parrot.dart';

name(ref) => 'Parrot';
hello(ref) => 'Hello ${ref(name)}';

final root = Module(
  providers: { name, hello },
);

void main() async {
  final app = Parrot(root);
  
  print(await app.resolve(hello));
}
```

This example will print `Hello Parrot` into the console.

You're thinking, `Isn't this complicating something simple?`, yes, it does in this hello example.

But when you have a complex application, you will find that Parrot is very useful.
